The site is built using Module Federation added in webpack 5.
Every apps expose app main page then `@genshin-timer/shell` aggregates them and use as pages.

- `app-*` ... Micro apps
- `app-*-types` ... Remote Container typings for each micro apps
- `module-federation` ... Utility scripts for Module Federation
- `shell` ... Outermost app
- `styles` ... Common styles (reset CSS, custom properties)
- `webpack` ... Common webpack configurations served as presets
